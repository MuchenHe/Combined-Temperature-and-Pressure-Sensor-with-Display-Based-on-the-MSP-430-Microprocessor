# Combined-Temperature-and-Pressure-Sensor-with-Display-Based-on-the-MSP-430-Microprocessor
Completed under the supervision of Dr. Andrzej Kotlicki at UBC. 
The library this code uses is from Alex with edits to fit the spicific requirements. 
For detailed infomation about it's construction, check out the Combined-Sensor-Report on my page


I have forked Alex's Library to my page for you convenience. The one that's compitable with my code is the display_utils.h and display_utils.c over on the forked page.
